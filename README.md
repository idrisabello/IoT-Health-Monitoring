# IoT Health Monitoring System  

An 'IoT-based health monitoring system' designed to track vital signs such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure using sensors, PCB design, and embedded systems. The project demonstrates how technology can be used to support healthcare delivery, especially in resource-limited settings.  


# Features of the IoT Health Monitoring System  

# Hardware & Embedded System  
- Designed and programmed using Arduino IDE (C/C++)  
- Integrated sensors (heart rate, temperature, SpOâ‚‚) with microcontrollers  
- Controlled actuators such as:  
  - 'Servo' motors for pill dispensing  
  - 'Buzzer' for alert notifications  
  - 'Vibrators' for patient feedback and reminders  
- Real-time signal acquisition and data processing at the edge  

# IoT & Connectivity  
- Implemented 'wireless data transmission' via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules  
- Sent health data to the 'Blynk App' for real-time monitoring and visualization  
- Enabled 'remote patient tracking' through mobile interface  

# System Design & Integration  
- Developed 'custom PCB design' for compact and reliable hardware  
- Integrated power management for continuous operation  
- Ensured modular design for easy upgrades and scaling


# System Architecture Diagram  

Below is a high-level architecture showing how the system works: 


# How It Works
1. Sensors capture patient vital signs.  
2. Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32) processes sensor data.  
3. Data is transmitted for logging and monitoring.  
4. Python scripts are used for visualization and analysis.  
5. Alerts are triggered if readings go beyond safe thresholds.
