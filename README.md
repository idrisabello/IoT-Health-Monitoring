# IoT Health Monitoring System  

An 'IoT-based health monitoring system' designed to track vital signs such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure using sensors, PCB design, and embedded systems. The project demonstrates how technology can be used to support healthcare delivery, especially in resource-limited settings.  


# Features of the IoT Health Monitoring System  

# Hardware & Embedded System  
- Designed and programmed using Arduino IDE (C/C++)  
- Integrated sensors (heart rate, temperature, SpO₂) with microcontrollers  
- Controlled actuators such as:  
  - 'Servo' motors for pill dispensing  
  - 'Buzzer' for alert notifications  
  - 'Vibrators' for patient feedback and reminders  
- Real-time signal acquisition and data processing at the edge  

# IoT & Connectivity  
- Implemented 'wireless data transmission' via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules  
- Sent health data to the 'Blynk App' for real-time monitoring and visualization  
- Enabled 'remote patient tracking' through mobile interface  

# System Design & Integration  
- Developed 'custom PCB design' for compact and reliable hardware  
- Integrated power management for continuous operation  
- Ensured modular design for easy upgrades and scaling


# How It Works

1. Data Collection 
   - Biomedical sensors (e.g., heart rate, temperature, SpO₂) capture real-time health data.  
   - The Arduino board reads sensor values through its analog and digital pins.  

2. Processing & Control 
   - The Arduino IDE code processes the data and applies threshold logic.  
   - If abnormal readings are detected, actuators (servo motor, buzzer, and vibrator) are triggered to alert the user or dispense medication.  

3. Data Transmission  
   - The processed health data is sent to the **Blynk IoT app** via Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32 module).  
   - The app provides real-time monitoring and visualization of the data.  

4. User Alerts & Actions 
   - Buzzer & Vibrator: Immediate local alerts when health readings cross dangerous thresholds.  
   - Servo Motor: Controls the automatic pill dispenser to release medication at the right time.  
   - Blynk Notifications: Sends alerts to caregivers or doctors through the app.

- Improved energy efficiency for long-term use
- Integrate AI/ML algorithms for predictive health analytics  
- Apply deep learning for anomaly detection in patient data  
- Use reinforcement learning for adaptive system optimization    

# How to Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the IoT-Based Health Monitoring System:
1. Hardware Setup
- Connect the following components to your Arduino/ESP board:
- Heart Rate Sensor → Analog/Digital pins (check wiring diagram).
- Temperature Sensor (LM35/DHT11) → Analog pin.
- Servo Motor → PWM pin.
- Buzzer → Digital pin.
- Vibrator Motor → Digital pin.
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32) → UART/Serial pins.
- Power your board via USB or external supply.

2. Software Requirements
- Install Arduino IDE
.- Required libraries (install via Arduino Library Manager):
- Blynk
- Servo.h
- Wire.h
- DHT.h (if using DHT11/22)
- Adafruit_Sensor (if using advanced sensors)

3. Blynk App Setup
- Download the Blynk IoT App (Android/iOS).
- Create a new project and select your device (ESP8266/ESP32/Arduino + WiFi).
Add widgets for:
- Heart Rate Display
- Temperature Gauge
- Alerts/Notifications
- Copy the Auth Token generated by Blynk.

4.  Code Setup
- Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IoT_Health_Monitor.git
cd IoT_Health_Monitor/src
- Open the iot_health_monitor.ino file in Arduino IDE.
- Enter your Wi-Fi and Blynk credentials in the code:

char auth[] = "YourBlynkAuthToken";
char ssid[] = "YourWiFiName";
char pass[] = "YourWiFiPassword";


- Select your board (Tools > Board > ESP8266/ESP32/Arduino Uno) and COM port.
- Upload the code.

5. Run the System
- Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to view sensor readings.
- Open the Blynk App to monitor health parameters in real-time.

The system will:
- Display heart rate and temperature.
- Trigger buzzer/vibration alerts if abnormal values are detected.
- Move the servo actuator when threshold is reached.

6.  Expected Output
- Normal Values → Displayed on Serial Monitor + Blynk Dashboard.
- Abnormal Values → Alarm triggers (buzzer + vibration), Blynk sends alert.
- Servo Actuation → Moves when programmed thresholds are reached.
